# Best Problem Statement

***The Young Catalyst*** is a platform for young minds to come
together to design authentic and innovative solutions for
their immediate environment. Students are required to make
their own Micro:bit contraption using recycled materials to
simulate a solution to a problem they have brought up.

<p>
Having little experience in prototyping, it was challenging
for us to design a contraption. Prior to this, my only
experience in prototyping was in lower secondary D&T class.
So, to be challenged into coming up with our own contraption
was not easy for me.
</p>
<p>
My team decided to work on different parts of the contraption
simultaneously. I worked on the Micro:bit code, while my
teammate worked on bringing the cardboard contraption to live.
</p>
<p>
My team made a contraption to cool classrooms down using a
ventilation system. As global warming worsens, daily
temperatures are on the rise and the weather has become more
unpredictable. In classrooms, students are always complaining
about the hot weather. Therefore, we created this contraption
in hopes of making students' study environment more conducive
and comfortable.
