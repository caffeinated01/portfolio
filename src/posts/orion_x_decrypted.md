Over the 2 days, we were trained to develop skills related to
cybersecurity. We learnt about cryptography which involves
encryption and decryption of ciphers, and digital forensics
which involves analysing meta data of files. We were also
presented with a Capture The Flag style competition, where we
were required to solve the most amount of questions to win.
Questions were phrased in a way that it was relevant to real
world contexts, something a cybersecurity analyst would face.

My team and I worked together and racked up as many points as
we could in the short time span we had, securing our spots as
first place.
