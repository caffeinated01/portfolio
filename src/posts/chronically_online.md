<p>Hello fellas, just came back from a long day of school and felt like writing on a topic, or rather behaviour observed among teenagers around my age.</p>
<p>That is, being ***chronically online***</p>
<p>With advancements in technology in the 2000's, communication has become more accessible. People are more inclined to stay home and look for online companionship on social media platforms as well as games. Many also find the thrill of gaming online more pleasing than going out.</p>
<p>What has this caused?</p>
<p>***Chronically Online***</p>
<p>The Urban Dictionary defines chronically online as _"Someone who is basically always on the internet and their entire existence revolves around being on the internet. People who are chronically online typically have no real friends IRL, and stay online starting useless debates that literally achieve nothing outside of a screen."_</p>
<p>As mentioned, people around me spend a considerable amount of time on the internet. This can affect their ability to engage in meaningful discussions as their understanding may be shaped by online experiences. Their language usage might be influenced by online slang, which differs significantly from language used in day to day conversations.</p>
<p>I have a friend who I would consider chronically online. He spends the vast majority of his time playing online games. When talking to him daily, he tends to use lots of metaphors and terminology from games he play. Being the unserious person he is, he uses of such references even in serious situations; these comments can come across as insensitive, especially if others are not comfortable with that tone. </p>
<p>The more time one spends on the internet, the more they look at life through the lens of it. Chronic online behaviour can cause social isolation. In the context of my personal experience, people can be alienated from society if they act weird. Since these people are heavily influenced by online experiences, this can lead to difficulties expressing themselves clearly as well as misinterpreting social cues.</p>
<p>In my opinion, such behaviour should be stopped at all costs. Looking at Gen Alpha, it is evident that being chronically online has taken a toll on ones' intellectual development. Start from being more physically active. Go for walks after a long day, or at least, reduce time spent on the internet.</p>
<p>Ok that is all for my rambling. Thanks for reading and have a good day ahead.</p>
