# Participant @ VJC & TP

<p>
Data Science Hackathon is a three-day bootcamp jointly
conducted by Temasek Polytechnic (TP) and Victoria Junior
College (VJC).

<p>
In this three-day hackathon, participants will learn the use
of Python in data analysis. Working in a team of 3,
participants will then apply what they have learnt in a group
project involving interesting, real-life contexts.

<p>
Our data set shows 769 different houses and their compactness,
surface area, wall area, roof area, height, orientation,
glazing level, glazing area distribution, heating and cooling
load.
</p>
<p>
Using the provided dataset, we were required to create a data
analysis and visualization pipeline to explore the factors
influencing energy efficiency in residential buildings.
Additionally, build a predictive model to estimate the energy
efficiency of a house based on its features.

We also had to present our data in the form of slides, which

<p>We learnt a lot about data analysis - the different types of graphs to plot when analysing data sets, the tell-tale signs of a invalid dataset, as well as training a linear regression model. We hope to hone our skills after this course.</p>
