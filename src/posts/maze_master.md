DSTO & DSO's Maze Master is a competition where participants are required
to write an algorithm for their robots to navigate a 4x4 maze
within the shortest time in order to win.

I was really skeptical that we would stand a chance against our competition, 
as we were a Media Club, not a Robotics team. With little to no experience with
Robotics, it would be a miracle to even get into the top 10. Undaunted by this
challenge, I led my team to read up the documentation for mbot2, and started piecing together parts of the algorithm. I faced many difficulties
along the way due to the documentation being quite unclear,
but through trial and error, our alogrithm was completed by
day 1. One take away from this experience was that preparing for competitions 
beforehand plays a paramount role in success.

During the actual competition, our robot initially ran into
issues, such as the sensor not being calibrated. We were quick
to troubleshoot, not panicking under pressure. Our robot
completed the maze faster than we had expected, securing us a
third place in the competition, beating many strong opponents.
