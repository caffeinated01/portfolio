# Participant @ VJC & TP

<p>Data Science Hackathon is a three-day bootcamp jointly
conducted by Temasek Polytechnic (TP) and Victoria Junior
College (VJC).</p>

# Day 1

<p>
First thing we went through was Mathematically Modelling. Mathematical modelling is translating a real world problem into the mathematical solution and explaining it.<br/>
The instructors then went on to teach us about the basics of Python.

# Day 2

<p>Started off the day with learning about Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The trainers went through EDA. EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis, which is the process of analysing and learning about trends in your data.</p>

<p>We then went on to Data Visualisation. Data visualisation is simply plotting graphs to simplify the process of identifying trends and patterns.</p>
<p>We plotted Histograms, Scatterplots, Boxplots, Bar Charts, Facetgrids, as well as a heatmap (correlation matrix) based on a dataset provided.</p>

# Project

<p>We were provided with a dataset containing information about various music tracks available on Spotify.
Each track has several attributes such as its name, artist(s), release date, and various metrics related to its characteristics and popularity.</p>

<p>I performed an EDA, cleaned the data and data visualistaion. The code can be found <a

<p>
We were also tasked to make a poster based on the statistics, which can be found <a

</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we did not make it into the final round of voting
due to the lack of exposure to other groups which resulted in us getting
insufficient votes.</p>
